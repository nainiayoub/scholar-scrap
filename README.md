Scholar Scrap is a helper tool that takes your text input and searches directly in Google Scholar for you, providing relevant information of research papers from Google Scholar results.

## How does it work?
* Simply enter your keywords in the text field.
* Select how many pages to scrap from Google Scholar results.
* As a result, you get a downloadable csv file containing:

|Paper title | Year | Author | Number of citations | Publication site | URL of the paper |
| ---------- | ---- | ------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |

_PS: A chart is also provided to display the distribution of papers by year and number of citations._
